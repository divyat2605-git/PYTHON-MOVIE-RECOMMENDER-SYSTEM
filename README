	PYTHON MOVIE RECMMENDER SYSTEM
The project incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as a key component for analyzing sentiment in movie reviews. 
RNNs are particularly well-suited for this task due to their ability to process sequential data, which is essential for understanding the context and nuances in text.
RNN and Sentiment Analysis
Sequential Data Handling: RNNs excel at handling sequences, making them ideal for tasks like sentiment analysis where the order of words affects meaning. 
By maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous inputs, RNNs can effectively learn the relationships between words in a review.
Sentiment Classification: In this project, RNNs are used to classify movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed. 
This classification helps in understanding user opinions about movies, which can then inform the recommendation system.
Training with Labeled Data: The RNN model is trained on labeled datasets containing movie reviews and their corresponding sentiments. 
This training enables the model to learn patterns associated with different sentiment classes.
Integration with Recommendation System: The insights gained from sentiment analysis can enhance the recommendation engine by providing a deeper 
understanding of user preferences and improving the personalization of movie suggestions.
By leveraging RNNs for sentiment analysis, the project aims to create a more robust recommendation system that not only predicts 
ratings but also aligns closely with user sentiments expressed in reviews. This dual approach enhances the overall effectiveness of the recommendation process, 
leading to improved user satisfaction.
